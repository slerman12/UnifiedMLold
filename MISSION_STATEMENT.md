[comment]: <> (*__AI is not about__ reproducing the effects of human intelligence in video games like Atari or simulated locomotive tasks like Humanoid. AI isn't even about making robots do those things in the real world. AI is about intelligence, artificially manifest via engineering yet no less profound than the biological variety, no less rooted in the natural principles of evolution, time, and incremental progress that have characterized the growth of intelligent life in the universe since the primordial biogenesis. These principles are rooted in nature, in the organic, beating heart of life, of all that is aware and experiences the qualia of being. Artificial Intelligence is therefore a misnomer, for it is no more artificial than a planned birth or a garden vs. wild meadows. AI is the plot of land that we till and sow with our bare hands, but the fruit of its germinating seed will be no less nourishing than that which God procured himself, and by this end we will create utopia, understand consciousness, and build the spirit of the heavens in our machines, for as Richard Feynman put it: to truly understand something, you must be able to build it yourself.*)

## Principles

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"
>
> -*Albert Einstein*

In our code, we strive for:

- *Minimalism*
- *Beauty*
- *Pedagogical clarity*
- *SOTA performance*

All 4.

On a broader level:

- *Humanity before mechanization*
- *Heart before calloused mind*
- *The earth and sky, mountains and brooks, fauna and flora, before industrialization*
  
[comment]: <> (- *The earth and trees, mountains and brooks, deer and caribou before industrialization* )

Politically:

- *Environmentalism*
- *Democratization*
- *Equity*

And going a step further:

- *Anti-militarism*
- *Anti-surveillance*

The latter two are less frequently cited by other, leading institutions.

## Our Pledge

We will always put humanity, nature, and Mother Earth first, ahead in the queue before money, bottom line, propriety, or even the art itself.

We will make technology that frees humankind to pursue the passions and callings of the spirit, not further enslave it beneath illusory mists of technological luxury, leaving no footprint of harm on the mental, physical, or spiritual spheres of biological existence.
